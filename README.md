## <a name="Tokyo"></a> Project 1 - Tokyo Olympics and World Happiness
PROCESS<br> 
Sorting: <br>
  1. Used VLOOKUP and Conditioning Formatting to match country names between World Happiness Report and listed 2020 Tokyo Olympic Teams/Countries<br>
  2. Manually corrected name differences between the two reports (ie. Great Britain and United Kingdom). Teams that were not represented in the World Happiness Report were excluded.<br>
  3. Results were then filtered by colour to present final matches to better identify any potential missing points of interest.<br>
